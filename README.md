# Introduction
If you have TIA Portal but don't have any machine to program, then this project is for you. It is a 3D simulation of *Packing Machine* which is controlled by *Siemens S7-PLCSIM* (virtual PLC). So basically you can program PLCSIM using TIA Portal, and test the program visually in the 3D graphical simulation.

# Prequisites
  - **Windows** operating system
  - Installed [**TIA Portal**](http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/tia-portal/Pages/default.aspx) and [**Simatic S7-PLCIM**](http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/simatic-controller-software/en/step7/simatic-s7-plcsim/pages/default.aspx) (both tested with V13)
