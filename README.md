# Introduction
If you have TIA Portal but don't have any machine to program, then this project is for you. It is a 3D simulation of *Packing Machine* which is controlled by *Siemens Step7 PLCSIM* (virtual PLC). So basically you can program PLCSIM using TIA Portal, and test the program visually in the 3D graphical simulation.
